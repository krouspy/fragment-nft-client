        The fragment you are holding is part of a picture that was taken a year
        ago in Paris, during ETHCC2019.

        Most projects, people, ideas that influence you on a daily basis to work
        on Ethereum are in it.

        The complete artwork is made of hundreds of small paths, each one
        independant from the other; with each one having its own constraints,
        objectives, turning points and achievements. Taken individually, they
        are nothing more than themselves; but if you take a step back, they are
        part of a bigger whole that exceeds the sum of them.
